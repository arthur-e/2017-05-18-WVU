Words are useful,
but what's more useful are the sentences and stories we build with them.
Similarly,
while a lot of powerful, general tools are built into languages like Python,
specialized tools built up from these basic units live in [libraries]({{ page.root }}/reference/#library)
that can be called upon when needed.

In order to load our climate data,
we need to access ([import]({{ page.root }}/reference/#import) in Python terminology)
a library called [NumPy](http://docs.scipy.org/doc/numpy/ "NumPy Documentation").
In general you should use this library if you want to do fancy things with numbers,
especially if you have matrices or arrays.
We can import NumPy using:

~~~
import numpy
~~~
{: .python}

Importing a library is like getting a piece of lab equipment out of a storage locker and setting it up on the bench.
Libraries provide additional functionality to the basic Python package,
much like a new piece of equipment adds functionality to a lab space.
Once you've imported the library,
we can ask the library to read our data file for us:

~~~
numpy.loadtxt(fname='01.temperature.csv', delimiter=',')
~~~
{: .python}

~~~
[[ 267.33  273.86  280.14 ...,  282.75  280.94  274.93]
 [ 276.93  276.79  277.91 ...,  287.66  278.27  275.46]
 [ 279.22  274.24  275.67 ...,  286.49  276.57  270.7 ]
 ...,
 [ 268.08  271.09  274.99 ...,  284.9   276.52  275.94]
 [ 270.69  267.18  276.62 ...,  284.8   281.92  280.42]
 [ 270.95  274.19  281.88 ...,  286.8   280.65  274.79]]
~~~
{: .output}

The expression `numpy.loadtxt(...)` is a [function call]({{ page.root }}/reference/#function-call)
that asks Python to run the [function]({{ page.root }}/reference/#function) `loadtxt` which belongs to the `numpy` library.
This [dotted notation]({{ page.root }}/reference/#dotted-notation) is used everywhere in Python
to refer to the parts of things as `thing.component`.

`numpy.loadtxt` has two [parameters]({{ page.root }}/reference/#parameter):
the name of the file we want to read,
and the [delimiter]({{ page.root }}/reference/#delimiter) that separates values on a line.
These both need to be character strings (or [strings]({{ page.root }}/reference/#string) for short),
so we put them in quotes.

When we are finished typing and press Shift+Enter,
the notebook runs our command.
Since we haven't told it to do anything else with the function's output,
the notebook displays it.
In this case,
that output is the data we just loaded.
By default,
only a few rows and columns are shown
(with `...` to omit elements when displaying big arrays).
To save space,
Python displays numbers as `1.` instead of `1.0`
when there's nothing interesting after the decimal point.

Our call to `numpy.loadtxt` read our file,
but didn't save the data in memory.
To do that,
we need to [assign]({{ page.root }}/reference/#assignment) the array to a [variable]({{ page.root }}/reference/#variable).
A variable is just a name for a value,
such as `x`, `current_temperature`, or `subject_id`.
Python's variables must begin with a letter and are [case sensitive]({{ page.root }}/reference/#case-sensitive).
We can create a new variable by assigning a value to it using `=`.
As an illustration,
let's step back and instead of considering a table of data,
consider the simplest "collection" of data,
a single value.
The line below assigns the value `55` to a variable `weight_kg`:

~~~
weight_kg = 55
~~~
{: .python}

Once a variable has a value, we can print it to the screen:

~~~
print(weight_kg)
~~~
{: .python}

~~~
55
~~~
{: .output}

and do arithmetic with it:

~~~
print('weight in pounds:', 2.2 * weight_kg)
~~~
{: .python}

~~~
weight in pounds: 121.0
~~~
{: .output}

As the example above shows,
we can print several things at once by separating them with commas.

We can also change a variable's value by assigning it a new one:

~~~
weight_kg = 57.5
print('weight in kilograms is now:', weight_kg)
~~~
{: .python}

~~~
weight in kilograms is now: 57.5
~~~
{: .output}

If we imagine the variable as a sticky note with a name written on it,
assignment is like putting the sticky note on a particular value:

![Variables as Sticky Notes](../fig/python-sticky-note-variables-01.svg)

This means that assigning a value to one variable does *not* change the values of other variables.
For example,
let's store the subject's weight in pounds in a variable:

~~~
weight_lb = 2.2 * weight_kg
print('weight in kilograms:', weight_kg, 'and in pounds:', weight_lb)
~~~
{: .python}

~~~
weight in kilograms: 57.5 and in pounds: 126.5
~~~
{: .output}

![Creating Another Variable](../fig/python-sticky-note-variables-02.svg)

and then change `weight_kg`:

~~~
weight_kg = 100.0
print('weight in kilograms is now:', weight_kg, 'and weight in pounds is still:', weight_lb)
~~~
{: .python}

~~~
weight in kilograms is now: 100.0 and weight in pounds is still: 126.5
~~~
{: .output}

![Updating a Variable](../fig/python-sticky-note-variables-03.svg)

Since `weight_lb` doesn't "remember" where its value came from,
it isn't automatically updated when `weight_kg` changes.
This is different from the way spreadsheets work.

{: .callout}

Just as we can assign a single value to a variable, we can also assign an array of values
to a variable using the same syntax.  Let's re-run `numpy.loadtxt` and save its result:

~~~
data = numpy.loadtxt(fname='01.temperature.csv', delimiter=',')
~~~
{: .python}

This statement doesn't produce any output because assignment doesn't display anything.
If we want to check that our data has been loaded,
we can print the variable's value:

~~~
print(data)
~~~
{: .python}

~~~
[[ 267.33  273.86  280.14 ...,  282.75  280.94  274.93]
 [ 276.93  276.79  277.91 ...,  287.66  278.27  275.46]
 [ 279.22  274.24  275.67 ...,  286.49  276.57  270.7 ]
 ...,
 [ 268.08  271.09  274.99 ...,  284.9   276.52  275.94]
 [ 270.69  267.18  276.62 ...,  284.8   281.92  280.42]
 [ 270.95  274.19  281.88 ...,  286.8   280.65  274.79]]
~~~
{: .output}

Now that our data is in memory,
we can start doing things with it.
First,
let's ask what [type]({{ page.root }}/reference/#type) of thing `data` refers to:

~~~
print(type(data))
~~~
{: .python}

~~~
<class 'numpy.ndarray'>
~~~
{: .output}

The output tells us that `data` currently refers to
an N-dimensional array created by the NumPy library.
These data correspond to air temperature values (BONUS: why do you think the values are so large?).
The rows are years and the columns are months in the year.

> of the same type. `type` will only tell you that

> ~~~
> {: .output}
>
> This tells us that the NumPy array's elements are
> [floating-point numbers]({{ page.root }}/reference/#floating-point number).
{: .callout}

We can see what the array's [shape]({{ page.root }}/reference/#shape) is like this:

~~~
print(data.shape)
~~~
{: .python}

~~~
(69, 12)
~~~
{: .output}

This tells us that `data` has 69 rows and 12 columns. When we created the
variable `data` to store our air temperature data, we didn't just create the array, we also
created information about the array, called [members]({{ page.root }}/reference/#member) or
attributes. This extra information describes `data` in
the same way an adjective describes a noun.
`data.shape` is an attribute  of `data` which describes the dimensions of `data`.
We use the same dotted notation for the attributes of variables
that we use for the functions in libraries
because they have the same part-and-whole relationship.

If we want to get a single number from the array,
we must provide an [index]({{ page.root }}/reference/#index) in square brackets,
just as we do in math:

~~~
print('first value in data:', data[0, 0])
~~~
{: .python}

~~~
first value in data: 267.33
~~~
{: .output}

~~~
print('middle value in data:', data[34, 6])
~~~
{: .python}

~~~
middle value in data: 295.48
~~~
{: .output}

The expression `data[34, 6]` may not surprise you, but the expression
`data[0, 0]` might.
Programming languages like Fortran and MATLAB start counting at 1,
because that's what human beings have done for thousands of years.
Languages in the C family (including C++, Java, Perl, and Python) count from 0
because it represents an offset from the first value in the array (the second
value is offset by one index from the first value). This is closer to the way
that computers represent arrays (if you are interested in the historical
reasons behind counting indices from zero, you can read
[Mike Hoye's blog post](http://exple.tive.org/blarg/2013/10/22/citation-needed/)).
As a result,
if we have an M×N array in Python,
its indices go from 0 to M-1 on the first axis
and 0 to N-1 on the second.
It takes a bit of getting used to,
but one way to remember the rule is that
the index is how many steps we have to take from the start to get the item we want.

{: .callout}

An index like `[34, 6]` selects a single element of an array,
but we can select whole sections as well.
For example,
we can select January and March air temperature (first three columns)
for the first 10 years (rows) like this:

~~~
print(data[0:10, 0:3])
~~~
{: .python}

~~~
[[ 267.33  273.86  280.14]
 [ 276.93  276.79  277.91]
 [ 279.22  274.24  275.67]
 ...,
 [ 270.78  273.27  278.63]
 [ 270.42  275.28  276.7 ]
 [ 270.12  275.77  277.41]]
~~~
{: .output}

The [slice]({{ page.root }}/reference/#slice) `0:10` means,
"Start at index 0 and go up to, but not including, index 10."
Again,
the up-to-but-not-including takes a bit of getting used to,
but the rule is that the difference between the upper and lower bounds is the number of values in the slice.

We don't have to start slices at `0:`.
For example, to select summer (June - August) air temperatures for the first 10 years...(recall that June is month 6, but Python indexing starts at 0, so it is column 5. August is month 8 or index 7, but to go _through_ August, we go _up to_ September -- month 9, index 8).

~~~
print(data[0:10, 5:8])
~~~
{: .python}

~~~
[[ 293.16  295.16  294.25]
 [ 294.65  297.23  294.97]
 [ 292.58  293.75  293.66]
 ...,
 [ 290.53  297.06  296.12]
 [ 292.46  294.18  293.62]
 [ 294.23  294.76  293.41]]
~~~
{: .output}

We also don't have to include the upper and lower bound on the slice.
If we don't include the lower bound,
Python uses 0 by default;
if we don't include the upper,
the slice runs to the end of the axis,
and if we don't include either
(i.e., if we just use ':' on its own),
the slice includes everything:

~~~
small = data[:3,5:8]
print('small is:')
print(small)
~~~
{: .python}

~~~
small is:
[[ 293.16  295.16  294.25]
 [ 294.65  297.23  294.97]
 [ 292.58  293.75  293.66]]
~~~
{: .output}

Arrays also know how to perform common mathematical operations on their values.
The simplest operations with data are arithmetic:
add, subtract, multiply, and divide.
 When you do such operations on arrays,
the operation is done on each individual element of the array.
Thus:

~~~
doubledata = data * 2.0
~~~
{: .python}

will create a new array `doubledata`
whose elements have the value of two times the value of the corresponding elements in `data`:

~~~
print('original:')
print(data[:3, 5:8])
print('doubledata:')
print(doubledata[:3, 5:8])
~~~
{: .python}

~~~
original:
[[ 293.16  295.16  294.25]
 [ 294.65  297.23  294.97]
 [ 292.58  293.75  293.66]]
doubledata:
[[ 586.32  590.32  588.5 ]
 [ 589.3   594.46  589.94]
 [ 585.16  587.5   587.32]]
~~~
{: .output}

If,
instead of taking an array and doing arithmetic with a single value (as above)
you did the arithmetic operation with another array of the same shape,
the operation will be done on corresponding elements of the two arrays.
Thus:

~~~
tripledata = doubledata + data
~~~
{: .python}

will give you an array where `tripledata[0,0]` will equal `doubledata[0,0]` plus `data[0,0]`,
and so on for all other elements of the arrays.

~~~
print('tripledata:')
print(tripledata[:3, 5:8])
~~~
{: .python}

~~~
tripledata:
[[ 879.48  885.48  882.75]
 [ 883.95  891.69  884.91]
 [ 877.74  881.25  880.98]]
~~~
{: .output}

As an exercise, how could you quickly convert these values from Kelvin to Celsius?
What about to Fahrenheit?

Often, we want to do more than add, subtract, multiply, and divide values of data.
NumPy knows how to do more complex operations on arrays.
If we want to find the average air temperature over this entire data set,
for example,
we can ask NumPy to compute `data`'s mean value:

~~~
print(numpy.mean(data))
~~~
{: .python}

~~~
283.815870048
~~~
{: .output}

`mean` is a [function]({{ page.root }}/reference/#function) that takes
an array as an [argument]({{ page.root }}/reference/#argument).
If variables are nouns, functions are verbs:
they do things with variables.

{: .callout}

NumPy has lots of useful functions that take an array as input.
Let's use three of those functions to get some descriptive values about the dataset.
We'll also use multiple assignment,
a convenient Python feature that will enable us to do this all in one line.

~~~
maxval, minval, stdval = numpy.max(data), numpy.min(data), numpy.std(data)

print('maximum temperature:', maxval)
print('minimum temperature:', minval)
print('standard deviation:', stdval)
~~~
{: .python}

~~~
maximum temperature: 297.3
minimum temperature: 263.94
standard deviation: 8.47084434071

{: .callout}

When analyzing data, though,
we often want to look at partial statistics,
such as the maximum value per year
or the monthly climatology (average of a month across all years).
One way to do this is to create a new temporary array of the data we want,
then ask it to do the calculation:

~~~
year_0 = data[0, :] # 0 on the first axis, everything on the second
print('maximum temperature for year 0:', year_0.max())
~~~
{: .python}

~~~
maximum temperature for year 0: 295.16
~~~
{: .output}

Everything in a line of code following the '#' symbol is a
[comment]({{ page.root }}/reference/#comment) that is ignored by the computer.
Comments allow programmers to leave explanatory notes for other
programmers or their future selves.

We don't actually need to store the row in a variable of its own.
Instead, we can combine the selection and the function call:

~~~
print('maximum temperature for year 2:', numpy.max(data[2, :]))
~~~
{: .python}

~~~
maximum temperature for year 2: 293.75
~~~
{: .output}

What if we need the maximum temperature for each year over all months (as in the
next diagram on the left), or the monthly climatology (as in the
diagram on the right)? As the diagram below shows, we want to perform the
operation across an axis:

![Operations Across Axes](../fig/python-operations-across-axes.png)

To support this,
most array functions allow us to specify the axis we want to work on.
If we ask for the average across axis 0 (rows in our 2D example),
we get:

~~~
print(numpy.mean(data, axis=0))
~~~
{: .python}

~~~
[ 271.72333333  273.01289855  277.85550725  283.60347826  288.58217391
  293.0113087   295.15942029  294.50565362  290.8284058   284.57637681
  278.93942029  273.99246377]
~~~
{: .output}

As a quick check,
we can ask this array what its shape is:

~~~
print(numpy.mean(data, axis=0).shape)
~~~
{: .python}

~~~
(12,)
~~~
{: .output}

The expression `(12,)` tells us we have an N×1 vector,
so this is the monthly climatology (average of each month over all years).
If we average across axis 1 (columns in our 2D example), we get:

~~~
print(numpy.mean(data, axis=1))
~~~
{: .python}

~~~
[ 283.9         284.98833333  283.60583333 ...,  283.0275      284.45916667
  285.22416667]
~~~
{: .output}

which is the mean annual temperature for each year.

The mathematician Richard Hamming once said,
"The purpose of computing is insight, not numbers,"
and the best way to develop insight is often to visualize data.
Visualization deserves an entire lecture (of course) of its own,
but we can explore a few features of Python's `matplotlib` library here.
While there is no "official" plotting library,
this package is the de facto standard.
First,
we will import the `pyplot` module from `matplotlib`
and use two of its functions to create and display a heat map of our data:

~~~
import matplotlib.pyplot
image = matplotlib.pyplot.imshow(data)
matplotlib.pyplot.show()
~~~
{: .python}

![Heatmap of the Data](../fig/01-numpy_71_0.png)

Blue regions in this heat map are low values, while red shows high values.
As we can see,
temperature rises in the summer months and decreases in the winter months.

{: .callout}

Let's take a look at the monthly climatology:

~~~
climatology = numpy.mean(data, axis=0)
ave_plot = matplotlib.pyplot.plot(climatology)
matplotlib.pyplot.show()
~~~
{: .python}

![Monthly climatology](../fig/01-numpy_73_0.png)

Here,
we have put the average per month across all years in the variable `climatology`,
then asked `matplotlib.pyplot` to create and display a line graph of those values.
The result is the expected seasonal progression of values.

Let's have a look at two other statistics:

~~~
max_plot = matplotlib.pyplot.plot(numpy.max(data, axis=0))
matplotlib.pyplot.show()
~~~
{: .python}

![Maximum Value Along The First Axis](../fig/01-numpy_75_1.png)

~~~
min_plot = matplotlib.pyplot.plot(numpy.min(data, axis=0))
matplotlib.pyplot.show()
~~~
{: .python}

![Minimum Value Along The First Axis](../fig/01-numpy_75_3.png)

You can group similar plots in a single figure using subplots.
This script below uses a number of new commands. The function `matplotlib.pyplot.figure()`
creates a space into which we will place all of our plots. The parameter `figsize`
tells Python how big to make this space. Each subplot is placed into the figure using
its `add_subplot` [method]({{ page.root }}/reference/#method). The `add_subplot` method takes 3 parameters. The first denotes
how many total rows of subplots there are, the second parameter refers to the
total number of subplot columns, and the final parameter denotes which subplot
your variable is referencing (left-to-right, top-to-bottom). Each subplot is stored in a
different variable (`axes1`, `axes2`, `axes3`). Once a subplot is created, the axes can
be titled using the `set_xlabel()` command (or `set_ylabel()`).
Here are our three plots side by side:

~~~
import numpy
import matplotlib.pyplot

data = numpy.loadtxt(fname='01.temperature.csv', delimiter=',')

fig = matplotlib.pyplot.figure(figsize=(10.0, 3.0))

![The Previous Plots as Subplots](../fig/01-numpy_80_0.png)

The [call]({{ page.root }}/reference/#function-call) to `loadtxt` reads our data,
and the rest of the program tells the plotting library
how large we want the figure to be,
that we're creating three subplots,
what to draw for each one,
and that we want a tight layout.
(Perversely,
if we leave out that call to `fig.tight_layout()`,
the graphs will actually be squeezed together more closely.)

> ## Scientists Dislike Typing
>
> We will always use the syntax `import numpy` to import NumPy.
> However, in order to save typing, it is
> [often suggested](http://www.scipy.org/getting-started.html#an-example-script)
> to make a shortcut like so: `import numpy as np`.
> If you ever see Python code online using a NumPy function with `np`
> (for example, `np.loadtxt(...)`), it's because they've used this shortcut.
> When working with other people, it is important to agree on a convention of how common libraries are imported.

>

>
> > ## Solution

> {: .solution}
>
> If we want to change this, we can use the `set_ylim(min, max)` method of each 'axes',

> ## Drawing Straight Lines
>
> In the center and right subplots above, we  expect all lines to look like step functions, because
> we only have monthly, not daily (or sub-daily), data. However, you can see
> that the lines are not always vertical or horizontal, and in particular the step function
> in the subplot on the right looks slanted. Why is this?
>
> > ## Solution
> > Because matplotlib interpolates (draws a straight line) between the points.
